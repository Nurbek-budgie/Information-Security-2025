I was listening to this music while doing my assignment

[Intro]
Five, four, three, two, one, ah!

[Verse 1]
You were a child crawling on your knees toward it
Making mama so proud, but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

[Chorus]
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

[Verse 2]
The water is warm, but it's sending me shivers
A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

[Chorus]
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees
